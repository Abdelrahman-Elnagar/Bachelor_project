WEATHER DATA PROCESSING STEPS - COMPLETE WORKFLOW
====================================================

This document summarizes all the steps performed to process German weather station data from raw files to clean CSV format.

INITIAL STATE:
- Raw weather data files in German format
- Station metadata files
- Various documentation files (.txt, .tex, .pdf, .bib)

STEP 1: CLEANING THE REGIONS FILE
---------------------------------
- Read the 'regions' file containing German weather station metadata
- Removed the word "Frei" from each line while preserving all other content
- File format: Fixed-width space-delimited data with station information

STEP 2: CONVERTING REGIONS TO CSV
--------------------------------
- Created Python script to parse fixed-width data into CSV format
- Extracted columns: Stations_id, von_datum, bis_datum, Stationshoehe, geoBreite, geoLaenge, Stationsname, Bundesland, Abgabe
- Corrected parsing issues by adjusting character positions for accurate field extraction
- Result: regions.csv with 667 stations

STEP 3: SORTING STATIONS BY BUNDESLAND
--------------------------------------
- Created script to sort regions.csv by "Bundesland" column
- All stations now organized alphabetically by German state
- Maintained data integrity during sorting process

STEP 4: REMOVING UNNECESSARY COLUMN
-----------------------------------
- Removed the "Abgabe" column from regions.csv
- Simplified dataset to essential station information only
- Final columns: Stations_id, von_datum, bis_datum, Stationshoehe, geoBreite, geoLaenge, Stationsname, Bundesland

STEP 5: PROCESSING STATIONS DATA FILE
-------------------------------------
- Received new file 'stations_data' containing zip file listings
- Converted to CSV format with columns: station_id, start_date, end_date, filename, date, time, size_bytes
- Used regex parsing to extract structured data from file listings
- Result: stations_data.csv with 636 data files

STEP 6: JOINING STATION METADATA WITH DATA FILES
------------------------------------------------
- Added "Data_file_name" column to regions.csv
- Performed join operation on station_id between regions.csv and stations_data.csv
- Used zero-padding (zfill(5)) to ensure consistent station ID matching
- Result: 636 stations matched with data files, 31 stations without data files

STEP 7: FILTERING STATIONS WITH DATA
------------------------------------
- Removed stations from regions.csv that don't have corresponding data files
- Final dataset: 636 stations, all with available weather data
- Ensured data completeness for analysis

STEP 8: EXTRACTING WEATHER DATA FILES
-------------------------------------
- Unzipped all 636 weather data zip files
- Extracted weather measurement files and metadata files
- Removed all zip files after successful extraction
- Result: 636 weather data files + metadata files

STEP 9: CLEANING UP METADATA FILES
-----------------------------------
- Removed all HTML metadata files (636 files)
- Removed all .txt files except those starting with "produk" (weather data files)
- Kept only essential weather data files and documentation

STEP 10: CONVERTING WEATHER DATA TO CSV
---------------------------------------
- Analyzed weather data file structure:
  * Format: Semicolon-delimited with header
  * Columns: STATIONS_ID, MESS_DATUM, QN_9, TT_TU, RF_TU, eor
  * Data: Hourly temperature and humidity measurements
- Created conversion script to transform all weather files to CSV format
- Processed 636 weather data files
- Total records converted: 151,390,976 weather measurements

STEP 11: REMOVING UNNECESSARY COLUMNS
-------------------------------------
- Removed "eor" column from all CSV files (638 files total)
- Cleaned up data structure for analysis
- Final weather data columns: STATIONS_ID, MESS_DATUM, QN_9, TT_TU, RF_TU

FINAL RESULT:
=============
- 636 weather station CSV files with clean, structured data
- 2 metadata CSV files (regions.csv, stations_data.csv)
