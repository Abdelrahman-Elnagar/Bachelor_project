Weather-Driven Model Selection in Renewable Energy Forecasting: A Focused Literature Review
1	Introduction
The integration of weather classification into the model selection process for renewable energy forecasting is an emerging research frontier. Rather than applying a single forecasting model universally, recent studies explore adaptive frameworks where the choice between statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models is dynamically informed by prevailing weather regimes or meteorological features. This approach aims to optimize forecasting accuracy by leveraging the strengths of different models under specific weather conditions. Notably, research demonstrates that model performance is highly sensitive to weather type, with certain models excelling under stable conditions and others under more variable or extreme weather (Cervantes et al., 2025; Serras et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2021; Jain, 2022; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022). Techniques such as clustering, weather type classification, and feature selection are increasingly used to guide model selection, with hybrid and ensemble approaches further enhancing adaptability and accuracy (Cervantes et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2021; Jain, 2022; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022). This review synthesizes the latest literature on weather-informed model selection for renewable energy production forecasting, highlighting methodologies, comparative findings, and practical implications.

2.1	Weather Classification and Model Selection Methodologies
Several studies employ weather classification (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, Lamb Weather Types) to segment data into regimes or clusters, each associated with distinct meteorological characteristics. Model selection is then tailored to these regimes, with different statistical or machine learning models applied to each cluster (Cervantes et al., 2025; Serras et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2021; Jain, 2022; Blazakis et al., 2024). For example, in solar radiation forecasting across K¨oppen climate zones, clustering by climate type and data dispersion led to the selection of optimal models for each region, with multivariate linear and polynomial models favored in tropical and arid climates, respectively (Cervantes et al., 2025). Similarly, adaptive frameworks use weather type classification to select or weight models dynamically, improving accuracy and robustness (Serras et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2021; Jain, 2022; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022).
2.2	Comparative Performance: Statistical vs. Deep Learning Models
Studies consistently find that the optimal model type varies with weather regime. Under stable meteorological conditions, simpler statistical or regression models often suffice, while deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, CNN-LSTM hybrids) outperform others during periods of high variability or extreme weather (Wang et al., 2021; Quinones et al., 2023; Jain, 2022; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022; Unlu & Pen˜a, 2025). For instance, in short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, support vector regression (SVR) excelled during unstable weather, while ensemble and hybrid deep learning models performed best overall when weather classification was integrated (Wang et al., 2021; Lim et al., 2022; Unlu & Pen˜a, 2025).
2.3	Hybrid and Meta-Learning Approaches
Hybrid and meta-learning frameworks are increasingly used to automate model selection based on weather features. These systems blend forecasts from multiple models, using meta-learners or ensemble strategies to assign weights or select the best-performing model for each weather regime (Sarmas et al., 2023; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022). For example, meta-learning approaches dynamically blend base forecasts from different deep learning architectures, learning which model performs best under specific weather conditions (Sarmas et al., 2023; Blazakis et al., 2024).
2.4	Practical Applications and Case Studies
Applications span solar and wind power forecasting, load forecasting, and climate model selection. In regional studies, adaptive frameworks using weather type classification have been shown to exclude poorly performing models and select those best suited to the variable or impact of interest, such as extreme heat or wind events (Serras et al., 2024; Jain, 2022; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022; Unlu & Pen˜a, 2025). These approaches are also used in operational settings, such as microgrid management and grid integration, where accurate, weather-adaptive forecasts are critical (Quin˜ones et al., 2023; Jain, 2022; Lim et al., 2022; Unlu & Pen˜a, 2025).

3	Discussion
The literature demonstrates that weather classification is a powerful tool for improving model selection in renewable energy forecasting. By segmenting data into meteorologically homogeneous regimes, researchers can tailor model choice to the specific characteristics of each regime, leading to significant gains in forecasting accuracy (Cervantes et al., 2025; Serras et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2021; Jain, 2022; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022; Unlu & Pen˜a, 2025). Deep learning models, particularly hybrid and ensemble approaches, show superior performance in highly variable or extreme weather, while statistical models remain competitive in stable conditions or data-scarce environments (Cervantes et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2021; Jain, 2022; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022; Unlu & Pen˜a, 2025). The use of meta-learning and automated model selection frameworks further enhances adaptability and operational utility (Sarmas et al., 2023; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022).
However, challenges remain. The complexity of implementing adaptive frameworks, the need for high-quality, weather-classified data, and the computational demands of deep learning models can limit practical deployment. Additionally, the interpretability of model selection decisions and the transferability of frameworks across regions and energy types require further research (Cervantes et al., 2025; Serras et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2021; Jain, 2022; Blazakis et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022; Unlu & Pen˜a, 2025).

Weather-driven model selection represents a significant advancement in renewable energy forecasting, enabling the dynamic use of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models tailored to specific meteorological regimes. This approach consistently improves forecasting accuracy and operational reliability, particularly when hybrid and meta-learning frameworks are employed. However, practical challenges related to data, complexity, and generalizability remain.
