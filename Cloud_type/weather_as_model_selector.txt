Statistical Models vs Deep Learning for Renewable
Energy Production Forecasting with Weather Classification: A Focused Literature Review
1	Introduction
Accurate forecasting of renewable energy production is essential for grid stability and efficient energy management, especially given the intermittent nature of sources like solar and wind power. The integration of weather classification into forecasting models has become increasingly important, as weather conditions are a primary driver of renewable energy variability. Recent literature demonstrates that while traditional statistical models (such as ARIMA and regression) have been widely used, deep learning models—particularly those leveraging large, complex weather datasets—are increasingly outperforming statistical approaches in both accuracy and adaptability, especially when weather classification is incorporated (Devaraj et al., 2021; Kumari & Toshniwal, 2021; Ahmed et al., 2020; Rajagukguk et al., 2020; Assaf et al., 2023; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Gupta & Singh, 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Gupta & Singh, 2021; Pombo et al., 2022). Hybrid and ensemble models that combine deep learning with statistical or machine learning techniques further enhance prediction performance, particularly in short-term forecasting scenarios (Souhe et al., 2024; Ahmed et al., 2020; Gupta & Singh, 2024; Ferkous et al., 2024; Lipu et al., 2021). However, challenges remain regarding model interpretability, computational demands, and the need for high-quality, weather-classified data. This review synthesizes the latest comparative research on statistical and deep learning models for renewable energy forecasting, with a specific focus on studies that incorporate weather classification.

2.1	Model Types and Weather Classification Approaches
Statistical models such as ARIMA, regression, and time series analysis have traditionally been used for renewable energy forecasting, often relying on linear relationships and smaller datasets. Deep learning models—including LSTM, GRU, CNN, and hybrid architectures—excel at capturing nonlinearities and complex temporal dependencies, especially when large, weather-classified datasets are available (Devaraj et al., 2021; Kumari & Toshniwal, 2021; Ahmed et al., 2020; Rajagukguk et al., 2020; Assaf et al., 2023;
Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Gupta & Singh, 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Gupta & Singh, 2021; Pombo et al., 2022; Ferkous et al., 2024; Asghar et al., 2024; Lipu et al., 2021).
Weather classification is typically achieved through clustering, regime identification, or feature selection based on meteorological variables (e.g., cloud cover, wind speed, temperature). Studies consistently report that incorporating weather classification improves model performance for both statistical and deep learning approaches, but the gains are more pronounced for deep learning models (Ahmed et al., 2020; Rajagukguk et al., 2020; Gupta & Singh, 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Gupta & Singh, 2021; Pombo et al., 2022).
2.2	Comparative Performance
Multiple reviews and empirical studies demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly LSTM and hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures, outperform statistical models in forecasting accuracy for both solar and wind energy when weather classification is included (Kumari & Toshniwal, 2021; Ahmed et al., 2020; Rajagukguk et al., 2020; Assaf et al., 2023; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Gupta & Singh, 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Gupta & Singh, 2021; Pombo et al., 2022; Ferkous et al., 2024; Asghar et al., 2024; Lipu et al., 2021). For example, hybrid models combining CNN and LSTM have shown improvements in prediction accuracy of up to 37% over standalone deep learning models and even greater gains over statistical models (Kumari & Toshniwal, 2021; Rajagukguk et al., 2020; Ferkous et al., 2024).
Statistical models remain competitive for short-term, linear, or data-sparse scenarios, but their performance plateaus with increasing data complexity, whereas deep learning models continue to improve with more data and richer weather features (Assaf et al., 2023; Gupta & Singh, 2024; Gupta & Singh, 2021; Pombo et al., 2022).
2.3	Hybrid and Ensemble Approaches
Hybrid models that integrate statistical, machine learning, and deep learning techniques—often optimized with evolutionary algorithms—consistently achieve the highest accuracy, especially for short-term forecasting and in scenarios with high weather variability (Souhe et al., 2024; Ahmed et al., 2020; Gupta & Singh, 2024; Ferkous et al., 2024; Lipu et al., 2021). Ensemble methods and physics-informed feature selection further enhance model robustness and generalizability (Pombo et al., 2022; Ferkous et al., 2024; Lipu et al., 2021).
2.4	Challenges and Limitations
Despite their superior performance, deep learning models face challenges related to interpretability, computational requirements, and the need for large, high-quality, weatherclassified datasets. Statistical models, while more interpretable and less resource-intensive, struggle with nonlinearities and large-scale data (Assaf et al., 2023; Dou et al., 2023; Gupta & Singh, 2021; Pombo et al., 2022; Lipu et al., 2021).

3	Discussion
The literature strongly supports the conclusion that deep learning models, especially when combined with weather classification, outperform traditional statistical models in forecasting renewable energy production (Devaraj et al., 2021; Kumari & Toshniwal, 2021; Ahmed et al., 2020; Rajagukguk et al., 2020; Assaf et al., 2023; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Gupta & Singh, 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Gupta & Singh, 2021; Pombo et al., 2022; Ferkous et al., 2024; Asghar et al., 2024; Lipu et al., 2021). The ability of deep learning to model nonlinearities and leverage large, complex datasets is particularly advantageous for capturing the variability inherent in renewable energy sources. Hybrid and ensemble models further enhance accuracy and robustness, though at the cost of increased computational complexity and reduced interpretability (Souhe et al., 2024; Ahmed et al., 2020; Gupta & Singh, 2024; Ferkous et al., 2024; Lipu et al., 2021).
However, the field faces several challenges. Deep learning models require substantial data and computational resources, and their ”black box” nature can hinder adoption in operational settings where transparency is critical (Assaf et al., 2023; Dou et al., 2023; Gupta & Singh, 2021; Pombo et al., 2022; Lipu et al., 2021). Statistical models remain valuable for their simplicity and interpretability, especially in data-limited or highly linear scenarios.
