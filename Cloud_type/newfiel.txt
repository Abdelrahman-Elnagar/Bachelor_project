# To test whether statistical models are enough for production forecasting in stable and unstable weather, **compare statistical models with advanced machine learning models across both conditions**.

## Recommended Model Selection and Experimental Design

### 1. Statistical Models (Baseline)
- **ARIMA, VAR, VECM, Linear Regression:** These are standard statistical models commonly used for time series and production forecasting. They provide a transparent baseline and are effective in stable, linear scenarios  (Hewage et al., 2020; Hachimi et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2020; Schultz et al., 2021).
- **Performance Expectation:** Statistical models often perform well in stable weather but may struggle with non-linearities and sudden changes in unstable conditions  (Hachimi et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2021; Schultz et al., 2021).

### 2. Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models (Comparative)
- **LSTM, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting:** These models are designed to capture complex, non-linear relationships and adapt to changing patterns, making them suitable for unstable weather scenarios  (Hewage et al., 2020; Hachimi et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2021; Schultz et al., 2021).
- **Hybrid/Ensemble Models:** Combining statistical and ML models (e.g., stacking, weighted ensembles) can further improve robustness and accuracy, especially under variable weather  (Vennila et al., 2022; Shahhosseini et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020).

### 3. Experimental Approach
- **Data Segmentation:** Divide your dataset into periods of stable and unstable weather using weather classification or clustering methods  (Wang et al., 2021).
- **Model Evaluation:** Train and test both statistical and ML models on each segment. Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, and skill scores to compare performance  (Hewage et al., 2020; Hachimi et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2021; Schultz et al., 2021).
- **Interpret Results:** If statistical models perform comparably to ML models in both conditions, they may be sufficient. If ML models outperform in unstable weather, statistical models alone are not enough.

|--------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| ARIMA/VAR/VECM     | Yes            | Yes              |  (Hewage et al., 2020; Hachimi et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2020; Schultz et al., 2021)|
| LSTM/TCN           | Yes            | Yes              |  (Hewage et al., 2020; Hachimi et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2021; Schultz et al., 2021)|
| Random Forest/GBR  | Yes            | Yes              |  (Wang et al., 2021; Schultz et al., 2021)|
| Hybrid/Ensemble    | Yes            | Yes              |  (Vennila et al., 2022; Shahhosseini et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020)|

## Conclusion

To rigorously test the sufficiency of statistical models, compare them directly with advanced ML models under both stable and unstable weather. This approach will reveal their relative strengths and limitations in each scenario.
