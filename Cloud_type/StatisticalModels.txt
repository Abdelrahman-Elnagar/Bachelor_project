Are statistical models effective for production forecasting?
Statistical models are effective for production forecasting in many scenarios, but their performance is often limited by data complexity, non-linearity, and changing conditions; advanced or hybrid approaches frequently yield better results.
Effectiveness of Statistical Models
Statistical models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and regression methods are widely used for production forecasting due to their simplicity, interpretability, and solid performance in stable, linear, and well-structured datasets. They provide a strong baseline and are especially effective for short-term forecasts or when data patterns are regular and not highly complex (Fatima & Rahimi, 2024; Makridakis et al., 2018; Szostek et al., 2024; Yin et al., 2016). In some cases, statistical models have even outperformed machine learning (ML) methods, particularly when computational efficiency and transparency are priorities (Makridakis et al., 2018; Szostek et al., 2024).
However, their effectiveness declines with increasing data complexity, non-linearity, or when external factors (like weather or promotions) introduce volatility. In such cases, statistical models may fail to capture intricate patterns, leading to reduced accuracy (Fatima & Rahimi, 2024; Sedai et al., 2023; Shahin et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2023; Satpathi et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2020). For example, in renewable energy and agricultural forecasting, statistical models often underperform compared to ML, deep learning, or ensemble models, especially for long-term or highly variable scenarios (Sedai et al., 2023; Satpathi et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2023).

Conclusion
Statistical models are effective for production forecasting in many standard cases, but their limitations become apparent with complex, non-linear, or volatile data. For optimal accuracy and robustness, especially in challenging environments, integrating advanced or hybrid modeling approaches is recommended.
