Deep Learning vs. Statistical Models in Energy Production Forecasting: A Comprehensive Literature Review
1	Introduction
Accurate forecasting of energy production is essential for the integration and management of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, into modern power grids. The literature reveals a clear trend: deep learning (DL) models and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques consistently outperform traditional statistical models in most energy forecasting scenarios, especially when dealing with complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional data (Sedai et al., 2023; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Wang et al., 2019). While statistical models like ARIMA and SARIMA remain useful for simpler, linear, or short-term forecasting tasks, their limitations become apparent as the complexity and variability of energy systems increase (Sedai et al., 2023; Haider et al., 2022; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Wang et al., 2019). Deep learning models—such as LSTM, GRU, CNN, and hybrid architectures—excel in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies, handling large datasets, and adapting to non-stationary patterns, leading to significant improvements in forecast accuracy and reliability (Sedai et al., 2023; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Wang et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2021; Husein et al., 2024; Mirza et al., 2023). However, challenges remain regarding data requirements, computational costs, and interpretability. This review synthesizes findings from recent comparative studies, meta-analyses, and case studies to provide a nuanced understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and future directions for both statistical and deep learning models in energy production forecasting.

2	Results
2.1	Model Performance: Statistical vs. Deep Learning
Multiple studies demonstrate that deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, CNN, hybrid models) consistently outperform traditional statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet) in forecasting energy production, particularly for complex, nonlinear, and multivariate time series data (Sedai et al., 2023; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; Alkandari & Ahmad, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Wang et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2021; Husein et al., 2024; Mirza et al., 2023). For example, deep learning models reduced mean absolute error by up to 47% compared to official statistical forecasts in national-level solar energy prediction (Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023), and hybrid deep learning models achieved superior accuracy and stability in both short- and long-term forecasts (Li et al., 2020; Jamil et al., 2023; Venkateswaran & Cho, 2024).
2.2	Application Domains and Case Studies
•	Solar Energy: Deep learning models, especially CNN-LSTM hybrids, outperform statistical models in both short- and long-term solar irradiance and power output forecasting (Sedai et al., 2023; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; Bassey, 2023; Li et al., 2020; Jamil et al., 2023; Kumari & Toshniwal, 2021; Luo et al., 2021; Husein et al., 2024; Venkateswaran & Cho, 2024).
•	Wind Energy: CNN and LSTM models show exceptional performance in wind speed and power prediction, capturing complex patterns better than ARIMA or regression models (Abdelsattar et al., 2025; Li et al., 2023; Zafar et al., 2022; Alc´antara et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2020; Mirza et al., 2023).
•	Hydropower and Load Forecasting: Deep learning models, including hybrid and probabilistic approaches, provide more accurate and reliable forecasts than statistical methods, especially for multivariate and probabilistic scenarios (Ehtearm et al., 2023; Mashlakov et al., 2021; Miroshnyk et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2024; Ramos et al., 2023).
2.3	Hybrid and Ensemble Approaches
Hybrid models that combine statistical and deep learning methods (e.g., SARIMA-Transformer, CNNLSTM, SSA-CNN-LSTM) further enhance forecasting accuracy, leveraging the strengths of both approaches (AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Husein et al., 2024; Venkateswaran & Cho, 2024; Mirza et al., 2023; Padilha et al., 2022). Ensemble methods and attention mechanisms also contribute to improved performance, particularly in handling uncertainty and non-stationarity (AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Garine & Sharma, 2025; Ofose et al., 2025; Mirza et al., 2023; Padilha et al., 2022).
2.4	Limitations and Challenges
•	Statistical Models: Struggle with nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and long-term forecasting; performance degrades rapidly with increased forecast horizon or data complexity (Sedai et al., 2023; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Wang et al., 2019).
•	Deep Learning Models: Require large, high-quality datasets and significant computational resources; risk of overfitting and challenges in interpretability and hyperparameter tuning (Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Kumari & Toshniwal, 2021; Luo et al., 2021; Husein et al., 2024; Alazemi et al., 2024).

2.5	Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks
Common metrics include MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R². Deep learning models consistently achieve lower error rates and higher R² values across diverse datasets and forecasting horizons (Sedai et al., 2023; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2021;

3	Discussion
The literature strongly supports the superiority of deep learning models over traditional statistical models in most energy production forecasting scenarios, especially as data complexity and forecasting horizons increase (Sedai et al., 2023; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Wang et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2021; Husein et al., 2024; Mirza et al., 2023). Deep learning models excel at capturing nonlinearities, temporal dependencies, and high-dimensional relationships, making them particularly well-suited for renewable energy forecasting where weather and environmental factors play a significant role (Sedai et al., 2023; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Wang et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2021; Husein et al., 2024; Mirza et al., 2023). Hybrid and ensemble approaches further enhance performance by combining the strengths of both model types (AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Husein et al., 2024; Venkateswaran & Cho, 2024; Mirza et al., 2023; Padilha et al., 2022).
However, deep learning models are not without challenges. They require substantial data and computational resources, and their ”black box” nature can hinder interpretability and trust in operational settings (Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Kumari & Toshniwal, 2021; Luo et al., 2021; Husein et al., 2024; Alazemi et al., 2024). Statistical models remain valuable for simpler, linear, or data-scarce scenarios, and their transparency and ease of implementation are advantageous in certain contexts (Sedai et al., 2023; Haider et al., 2022; Cabello-L´opez et al., 2023; AlKandari & Ahmad, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2021; Alkhayat & Mehmood, 2021; Wang et al., 2019).
4	Conclusion
Recent advances in deep learning have revolutionized energy production forecasting, with DL models consistently outperforming traditional statistical approaches in accuracy, robustness, and adaptability to complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional data. Hybrid and ensemble models offer further improvements, while statistical models retain value in specific, simpler contexts. Ongoing challenges include data requirements, computational costs, and interpretability.
4.1	Research Gaps
Despite significant progress, several gaps remain:
•	Limited research on interpretability and explainability of deep learning models in operational energy forecasting.
•	Insufficient studies on the performance of models in data-scarce or highly volatile environments.
•	Few large-scale, standardized benchmarks for cross-comparison of models across diverse geographies and energy types.
